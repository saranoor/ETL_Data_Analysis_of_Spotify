# ETL Pipeline and Analysis of Spotify Data 

# Description
This project involves pulling data from Spotify API, creating a database using SQlite, and running the required analysis. Following are the 3 main steps of my project. 

- By using the Spotify API, I have created a python script that fetches information of tracks (name, popularity, duration_ms, etc) and information of artists (name, popularity, followers, etc) for a playlist name Rapcavier. 
- I have designed two tables in SQlite database to store the information of tracks and artist I have extracted in step 1. 
- I have written SQL queries to query data to ran following analysis;
  - How many songs are in the playlist?
  - What are the top 5 tracks by artist follower count?
  - Which song is the longest?
  - What is the relationship between track and artist popularity?
